The Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH) signalling cascade is involved in the modulation of growth hormone release from the anterior pituitary somatotropic cells. The signal transduction begins via the stimulation of GHRH belonging to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors. Dysregulation of GHRH signalling has been implicated in tumorigenesis, the development of cancer cells. However, the discrete mechanism of this cellular disturbance has not yet been elucidated. The constitutively activating mutation in the Gs alpha subunit (GNAS) of trimeric G-protein linked to the GHRHR has been found in pituitary-driven malignancies. Constitutively activated Gs alpha upregulates  adenylate cyclase enzymes leading to increased concentration of the secondary messenger Ð cAMP. However, previous in vitro experiments have suggested that upregulated cAMP does not lead to constitutive exocytosis of Growth Hormone from somatotropic cells. This model complements the in-vitro studies performed during the investigation of GHRH-mediated attenuation of signalling.  The model was built to allow the comparison between experiments performed upon rat somatotropic tumour (GC) cells and kinetic data published previously; it provides a platform for studying GHRH signalling occurring in the cell, and can be found as an SBML file, created using COPASI software. The biochemical stimulation can be performed as time course and parameter scans against varying concentrations of both GHRH and GNAS. I would like to thank Dr Melanie Stefan for her patience and contribution, and further offer my gratitude to Dr Joanne Murray and Dr Paul Le Tissier for their support and help during the in the in-vitro part of the project. Additionally, I would like to thank Richard Fitzpatrick for his model of MAPK pathway that can be used to expand the scope of my study and account for MAPK involvement in the GHRHR dysregulation.
